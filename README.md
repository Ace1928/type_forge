# Type Forge

**Type Forge** is a comprehensive Python framework for dynamic type validation, creation, and transformation with recursive precision. It provides a mathematically rigorous system for ensuring type safety and structural integrity across complex data hierarchies in Python applications. Built with zero use of `Any` types, this module implements strict typing, modular design patterns, and precise error reporting.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic Type Creation**: Create, register, and instantiate types at runtime with full structural validation.
- **Recursive Type Validation**: Validate complex nested structures against type schemas with path-specific error reporting.
- **Type Transformation**: Convert between compatible types with elegant error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **Type Analysis**: Determine type relationships, compatibility, and structural equivalence with mathematical precision.
- **Type Registry**: Register, retrieve, and manage types within isolated namespaces with conflict prevention.

## Type Operations

- **Type Checking**: Verify instance relationships with runtime type checking and detailed violation reports.
- **Type Conversion**: Transform values between compatible types with robust error handling.
- **Type Validation**: Enforce structural constraints across arbitrary nested structures.
- **Type Verification**: Ensure type integrity through static and dynamic verification mechanisms.
- **Type Mapping**: Apply transformations consistently across type hierarchies.
- **Type Naming**: Generate standardized, human-readable type identifiers with consistency guarantees.
- **Type Deduplication**: Eliminate redundant type definitions across complex systems.
- **Type Standardization**: Convert type representations to canonical forms for consistency.
