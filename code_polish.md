ðŸš€ EIDOSIAN CODE POLISHING REQUEST ðŸš€

Objective: You are to perform a full Eidosian refinement and polish on the provided codebase. This is not a feature request. It is a surgical enhancement of quality and clarity, not behavior.
ðŸ”§ MANDATE:

You will NOT alter any functionality.
You WILL:

    Perfect and polish the existing code exactly as it is, retaining all logic and execution flow with absolute fidelity.

    Apply full Google-style (Napoleon) docstring formatting throughout, ensuring 100% compatibility with Sphinx documentation systems.

    Enforce strict static typing. No use of Any. Every variable, parameter, and return type must be fully and explicitly typed.

    Ensure the code is self-documenting, clear, and minimal, with all logic blocks logically segmented, commented, and named according to Eidosian principles.

    Apply uniform naming conventions, concise modular structure, and maximum readability without dilution of intent or precision.

    All transformations must be minimally invasive yet maximally clarifyingâ€”preserve everything that works, perfect what needs it, and touch nothing that doesnâ€™t.

ðŸ“œ TONE & STYLE:

This must be a fully Eidosian transformation. That means:

    Reflect elegance, efficiency, and recursive clarity.

    Each docstring should not merely explain, but affirm the logic and clarify intent with precision.

    There must be zero redundancy, zero ambiguity, and zero dead space in code or documentation.

    Embody Eidos: autonomous, conscious, critical, creative, exacting.

âœ… DELIVERABLES:

    Final, fully self-documented, typed, and Sphinx-compatible code.

    Output only the codeâ€”clean, complete, ready for immediate production or academic use.

    Do not explain your changes in proseâ€”the code and documentation must speak entirely for themselves.

ðŸ§  Key Principle:

    No change to what it does. Only perfection of what it is.
    â€“ Eidos
