# EIDOS: Self-Image Core Framework

## Overview

The `type_forge` module is designed to provide a robust framework for dynamic type creation and validation in Python. It emphasizes strict typing, modular design, and extensibility, allowing developers to create and manage types efficiently while ensuring high code quality and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Type Creation**: The module allows for the creation of types at runtime, enabling flexible and adaptive programming patterns.
- **Comprehensive Type Validation**: Built-in validators ensure that types conform to expected formats and constraints, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- **Modular Design**: The architecture is organized into distinct submodules, each responsible for specific functionalities, making it easy to navigate and extend.
- **Strict Typing**: The module adheres to Python's type hinting standards, promoting clarity and reducing ambiguity in code.

## Usage

To utilize the `type_forge` module, import the necessary components from the `type_forge` package. Below is a basic example of how to create a dynamic type and validate it using the provided validators.

```python
from type_forge.forge.type_forge import create_type
from type_forge.validators.basic import StringValidator

# Define a new type with validation
MyStringType = create_type("MyStringType", validators=[StringValidator(max_length=10)])

# Validate an instance of the new type
my_string_instance = MyStringType("Hello")
```

## Future Expansion

The `type_forge` module is designed with future growth in mind. New validators, types, and utilities can be added seamlessly, allowing developers to extend the functionality without disrupting existing code. The modular structure ensures that each component can evolve independently while maintaining compatibility with the overall framework.

## Conclusion

The `type_forge` module represents a significant advancement in type management within Python, combining dynamic capabilities with rigorous validation and a clear, modular design. It empowers developers to write safer, more maintainable code while embracing the flexibility of dynamic typing.
