# Contributing to Type Forge

Thank you for considering contributing to Type Forge! This document outlines the principles, workflows, and expectations for contributors.

## Eidosian Principles

Type Forge follows Eidosian principles of clarity, rigor, and thoughtful design:

- **Truth in Types**: All code must respect the type system as foundational truth
- **Explicit over Implicit**: Prefer explicit declarations over inference when clarity is at stake
- **Form Follows Function**: Design decisions must serve practical programming needs
- **Elegance through Constraint**: Embrace limitations that lead to better solutions

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/Ace1928/type_forge.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or appropriate command)
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-contribution`

## Contribution Workflow

1. Ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines
2. Write tests that validate your changes
3. Document new features or behavior changes
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Code Standards

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Document public APIs with TypeDoc comments
- Maintain 100% type safety (no `any` types without justification)
- Write unit tests for all new functionality

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation as needed
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure CI passes on your branch
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Address feedback promptly

## Community
